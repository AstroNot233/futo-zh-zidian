Note:
* Removed `symbols.yaml`, `key_bindings.yaml`.
  There is no need to keep them for mobile platforms. For compatibility, placeholder is left for them.
* Modified `punctuation.yaml`.
  For mobile platforms, it's easier to input full-width punctuations. Mapping half-width to full-width like PC might cause inconvenience.
